Abstract

   This document provides a summary of the 'Workshop on Internet of
   Things (IoT) Semantic Interoperability (IOTSI)', which took place in
   Santa Clara, CA, on March 17-18, 2016.  The main goal of the workshop
   was to foster a discussion on the different approaches used by
   companies and standards developing organizations (SDOs) to accomplish
   interoperability at the application layer.  This report summarizes
   the discussions, and lists recommendations to the standards
   community.  The views and positions in this report are those of the
   workshop participants and do not necessarily reflect those of the
   authors and the Internet Architecture Board (IAB), which organized
   the workshop.

1.  Introduction

   The Internet Architecture Board (IAB) holds occasional workshops
   designed to consider long-term issues and strategies for the
   Internet, and to suggest future directions for the Internet
   architecture.  The investigated topics often require coordinated
   efforts of many organizations and industry bodies to improve an
   identified problem.  One of the targets of the workshops is to
   establish communication between relevant organizations, especially
   when the topics are out of the scope for the Internet Engineering
   Task Force (IETF).  This long-term planning function of the IAB is
   complementary to the ongoing engineering efforts performed by working
   groups of the IETF.

   With the expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT), interoperability
   becomes more and more important.  Standards developing organizations

   (SDOs) have done a tremendous amount of work to standardize new
   protocols, and to profile existing protocols.

   At the application layer and at the level of solution frameworks,
   interoperability is not yet mature.  Particularly, the work on data
   formats (in the form of data models and information models) has not
   seen the same level of consistency throughout SDOs.

   One common problem is the lack of an encoding-independent
   standardization of the information, the so-called information model.
   Another problem is the strong relationship with the underlying
   communication architecture, such as an Remote Procedure Call (RPC) or
   a RESTful design.  Furthermore, groups develop solutions that are
   very similar on the surface but differ slightly in their standardized
   outcome, leading to interoperability problems.  Finally, some groups
   favor different encodings for use with various application layer
   protocols.

   Thus, the IAB decided to organize a workshop to reach out to relevant
   stakeholders to explore the state-of-the-art and to identify
   commonality and gaps [IOTSIAG], [IOTSIWS].  In particular, the IAB
   was interested to learn about the following aspects:

   o  What is the state of the art in data and information models?  What
      should an information model look like?

   o  What is the role of formal languages, such as schema languages, in
      describing information and data models?

   o  What is the role of metadata, which is attached to data to make it
      self-describing?

   o  How can we achieve interoperability when different organizations,
      companies and individuals develop extensions?

   o  What is the experience with interworking various data models
      developed from different groups, or with data models that evolved
      over time?

   o  What functionality should online repositories for sharing schemas
      have?

   o  How can existing data models be mapped against each other to offer
      interworking?

   o  Is there room for harmonization, or are the use cases of different
      groups and organizations so unique that there is no possibility
      for cooperation?

   o  How can organizations better work together to increase awareness
      and information sharing?

2.  Terminology

   The first roadblock to interoperability at the level of data models
   is the lack of a common vocabulary to start the discussion.
   [RFC3444] provides a starting point by separating conceptual models
   for designers, or "information models", from concrete detailed
   definitions for implementers, or "data models".  There are concepts
   that are undefined in that RFC and elsewhere, such as the interaction
   with the resources of an endpoint, or "interaction model".  Therefore
   the three "main" common models that were identified were:

   Information Model
      An information model defines an environment at the highest level
      of abstraction, they express the desired functionality.  They can
      be defined informally (e.g., in plain English) or more formally
      (e.g., UML, Entity-Relationship Diagrams, etc.).  Implementation
      details are hidden.

   Data Model
      A data model defines concrete data representations at a lower
      level of abstraction, including implementation and protocol-
      specific details.  Some examples are: SNMP Management Information
      Base (MIB) modules, W3C Thing Description (TD) Things, YANG
      models, LWM2M Schemas, OCF Schemas and so on.

   Interaction Model
      An interaction model defines how data is accessed and retrieved
      from the endpoints, being therefore tied to the specific
      communication pattern that the system has (e.g., REST methods,
      Publish/Subscribe operations, or RPC calls).

   Another identified terminology issue is the semantic meaning overload
   that some terms have.  The meaning can vary depending on the context
   in which the term is used.  Some examples of such terms are:
   semantics, models, encoding, serialization format, media types or
   encoding types.  Due to time constraints, no concrete terminology was
   agreed upon, but work will continue within each organization to
   create various terminology documents.  The participants agreed to set
   up a github repository [IOTSIGIT] for sharing information.

3.  What Problems to Solve

   The participants agreed that there is not simply a single problem to
   be solved, but rather a range.  During the workshop the following
   problems were discussed:

Internet-Draft          draft-iab-iotsi-workshop              March 2018


   o  Formal Languages for Documentation Purposes

   To simplify review and publication, SDOs need formal descriptions of
   their data and interaction models.  Several of them use a tabular
   representation found in the specification itself, but use a formal
   language as an alternative way of describing objects and resources
   for formal purposes.  Some examples of formal language use are as
   follows.

   The Open Mobile Alliance (OMA), now OMA SpecWorks, used an XML schema
   [LWM2M-Schema] to describe their object and resource definitions.
   The XML files of standardized objects are available for download at
   [OMNA].

   The Bluetooth SIG defined Generic Attributes (GATT) services and
   characteristics for use with Bluetooth Smart/Low Energy.  The
   services and characteristics are shown in a tabular form on the
   Bluetooth SIG website at [SIG], and are also defined as XML instance
   documents.

   The Open Connectivity Foundation (OCF) uses JSON Schemas to formally
   define data models, and RAML to define interaction models.  The
   standard files are available online at OneIoTa.org.

   The AllSeen Alliance uses AllJoyn Introspection XML to define data
   and interaction models in the same formal language, tailored for RPC-
   style interation.  The standard files are available online on the
   AllSeen Alliance web site, but both standard and vendor-defined model
   files can be obtained by directly querying a device for them at
   runtime.

   The World-Wide Web Consortium (W3C) uses the Resource Description
   Framework (RDF) to define data and interaction models using a format
   tailored for the web.

   The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) uses YANG to define data
   and interaction models.  Other SDOs may use various other formats.

   o  Formal Languages for Code Generation

   Code generation tools that use formal data and information modelling
   languages are needed by developers.  For example, the Allseen Visual
   Studio Plugin [Allseen-Plugin] offers a wizard to generate code based
   on the formal description of the data model.  Another example of a
   data modelling language that can be used for code generation is YANG.
   A popular tool to help with code generation of YANG modules is pyang
   [PYANG].  An example of a tool that can do code generation for
   multiple ecosystems is OpenDOF [OpenDOF].  Use cases discussed for

Internet-Draft          draft-iab-iotsi-workshop              March 2018


   code generation included easing development of server-side device
   functionality, clients, and compliance tests.

   o  Debugging Support

   Debugging tools are needed that implement generic object browsers,
   which use standard data models and/or retrieve formal language
   descriptions from the devices themselves.  As one example, the NRF
   Bluetooth Smart sniffer from Nordic Semiconductor [nRF-Sniffer] can
   be used to display services and characteristics defined by the
   Bluetooth SIG.  As another example, AllJoyn Explorer
   [AllJoynExplorer] can be used to browse and interact with any
   resource exposed by an AllJoyn device, including both standard and
   vendor-defined data models, by retrieving the formal descriptions
   from the device at runtime.

   o  Translation

   The working assumption is that devices need to have a common data
   model with a priori knowledge of data types and actions.  However
   that would imply that each consortia/organization will try to define
   their own, causing a major interoperability problem, if not a
   completely intractable one given the ammount of variations,
   extensions, compositions or versioning changes that will happen on a
   per data model basis.

   Another potential approach is to have a minimal ammount of
   information on the device to allow for a runtime binding to a
   specific model.  The objective being to require as little a prior
   knowledge as possible.

   Moreover, gateways, bridges and other similar devices need to
   dynamically translate (or map) one data model to another one.
   Complexity will increase as there are also multiple protocols and
   schemas that will make interoperability harder to achieve.

   o  Runtime Discovery

   Runtime discovery allows IoT devices to exchange metadata about the
   data, potentially along with the data exchanged itself.  In some
   cases the metadata not only describe data but also the interaction
   model as well.  An example of such an approach has been shown with
   HATEOAS [HATEOAS].  Another example is that all AllJoyn devices
   support such runtime discovery using a protocol mechanism called
   "introspection", where the metadata is queried from the device itself
   [AllSeen].

Internet-Draft          draft-iab-iotsi-workshop              March 2018


   There are various models, whether deployed or possible, for such
   discovery.  The metadata might be extracted from a specification, or
   looked up on a cloud repository (e.g., OneIoTa for OCF models), or
   looked up via a vendor's site, or obtained from the device itself as
   (such as in the AllJoyn case).  The relevant metadata might be
   obtained from the same place, or different pieces might be obtained
   from different places, such as obtaining separately information such
   as (a) syntax information, (b) end-user descriptions in a desired
   language, and (c) developer-specific comments for implementers.

4.  Translation

   In an ideal world where organizations and companies cooperate and
   agree on a single data model standard, there is no need for gateways
   that translate from one data model to the other one.  However, this
   is far from reality today, and there are many proprietary data models
   in addition to the already standardized ones.  As a consequence,
   gateways are needed to translate between data models.  This leads to
   n^2-n combinations, in the worse case.

   There are analogies with gateways back in the 1980s that were used to
   translate between network layer protocols.  Eventually IP took over,
   providing the necessary end-to-end interoperability at the network
   layer.  Unfortunately, the introduction of gateways leads to the loss
   of expressiveness due to the translation between data models.  The
   functionality of IP was so valuable in the market that advanced
   features of other networking protocols became less attractive and
   were not used anymore.

   Participants discussed an alternative, called 'red star' shown in
   Figure 1, where data models are translated to the data model shown in
   the middle.  This reduces the number of translations that are needed
   down to 2n (in the best case).  Of course, everyone wants to be the
   red star data model.

           Figure 1: The 'Red Star' in Data/Information Models.

   While the workshop itself was not a suitable forum to discuss the
   design of such translation model several questions were raised:

   o  Do we need a red star that does everything or could we design
      something that offers a more restricted functionality?

   o  How do we handle loss of data and loss of functionality?

   o  Should data be translated between data models or data models be
      translated?

   o  How can interaction models be translated?  It needs to be dealt
      with in addition to the data model.

   o  Many (if not all) data and interaction models have some bizarre
      functionality that cannot be translated easily.  How can those be
      handled?

   o  What limitations are we going to accept in these translations?

   o  When should translation happen?

   a) Design time: a translation between data model descriptions, such
   as translating a YANG model to a RAML/JSON model, can be performed
   once, such as during design time.  A single information model can be
   mapped to a number of different data models.

   b) Run time: Runtime translation of values in two standard data
   models can only be algorithmically done when the data model on one
   side is algorithmically derived from the data model on the other
   side.  This is called a "derived model".  It was discussed that the
   availability of runtime discovery can aid in semantic translation,
   such as when a vendor-specific data model on one side of a protocol
   bridge is resolved and the translator can algorithmically derive the
   semantically-equivalent vendor-specific data model on the other side
   of a protocol bridge, as discussed in [BridgeTaxonomy].

   The participants agreed that algorithm translation will generally
   require custom code, whenever one is translating to anything other
   than a derived model.

   Participants were under the impression that it is easier to translate
   data between systems that follow the same communication architecture.

5.  Dealing with change

   A large part of the workshop was dedicated to the evolution of
   devices and server side applications.  Interactions between devices
   and services and how their relationship evolves over time is
   complicated by their respective different interaction models.

   The workshop discussed various approaches to deal with change.  In
   the most basic case, a developer might use a description of an API
   and implement the protocol steps.  Sometimes the data or information
   model can be used to generate code stubs.  Subsequent changes to an
   API require changes on the clients to upgrade to the new version,
   which requires some development of new code to satisfy the needs of
   the new API.

   These interactions could be made machine-understandable in the first
   place, enabling for changes to happen at runtime.  In that scenario,
   a machine client could discover the possible interactions with a
   service, adapting to changes as they occur without specific code
   being developed to adapt to them.

   The challenge seems to be to code the human-readable specification
   into a machine-readable format.  Machine-readable languages require a
   shared vocabulary to give meaning to the tags.





Jimenez, et al.        Expires September 20, 2018               [Page 9]

Internet-Draft          draft-iab-iotsi-workshop              March 2018


   These types of interactions are often based on the REST architectural
   style.  Its principle is that a device or endpoint only needs a
   single entry point with a host providing descriptions of the API in-
   band by means of web links and forms.

   By defining IoT-specific relation types, it is possible to drive
   interactions through links instead of hardcoding URIs into a RESTful
   client, thus making the system flexible enough for later changes.
   The definition of the basic hypermedia formats for IoT is still work
   in progress.  However, some of the existing mechanisms can be reused,
   such as resource discovery, forms, or links.

6.  Security Considerations

   There were two types of security considerations discussed: use of
   formal data models for security configuration, and security of data
   and data models in general.

   It was observed that the security assumptions and configuration, or
   "security model", varies by ecosystem today, making the job of a
   translator difficult.  For example, the types of security principals
   (e.g., user vs. device vs. application), the use of access control
   lists (ACLs) vs. capabilities, and what types of policies can be
   expressed, all vary by ecosystem.  As a result, the security model
   architecture generally dictates where translation can be done.

   One approach discussed was whether two endpoints might be able to use
   some overlay security model, across a translator between two
   ecosystems, which only works if the two endpoints agree on a common
   data model for their communication.  Another approach discussed was
   simply having a translator act as a trusted intermediary, which
   allows the translator to be able to translate between different data
   models.

   One suggestion discussed was potentially adding metadata into either
   the formal data model language, or accompanying the data values over
   the wire, tagging the data with privacy levels.  However, sometimes
   even the privacy level of information might itself be sensitive.
   Still, it was observed that being able to dynamically learn security
   requirements might help provide better UIs and translators.

7.  Collaboration

   The participants discussed how best to share information among their
   various organizations.  One discussion was around having joint
   meetings.  One current challenge reported was that organizations were
   not aware of when and where each others' meetings were scheduled, and
   sharing such information could help organizations better collocate

   meetings.  To facilitate this exchange, the participants agreed to
   add links to their respective meeting schedules from a common page in
   the IOTSI repository [IOTSIGIT].

   Another challenge reported was that organizations did not know how to
   find each others' published data models, and sharing such information
   could better facilitate reuse of the same information model.  To
   facilitate this exchange, this participants discussed whether a
   common repository might be used by multiple organizations.  The OCF's
   OneIoTa repository was discussed as one possibility but it was
   reported that its terms of use at the time of the workshop prevented
   this.  The OCF agreed to take this back and look at updating the
   terms of use to allow other organizations to use it too, as the
   restriction was not the intent.  Schema.org was discussed as another
   possibility.  In the meantime, the participants agreed to add links
   to their respective repositories from a common page in the IOTSI
   repository [IOTSIGIT].

   It was also agreed that the iotsi@iab.org mailing list would remain
   open and available for sharing information between all relevant
   organizations.
